# VLC_Channel_Estimation_in_Oil_Fields
This project uses an autoencoder-based deep learning model for wireless channel matrix estimation. The encoder compresses real and imaginary parts, while the decoder reconstructs the refined matrix. It optimizes channel gains for improved spectral efficiency, ensuring robust communication across transmitter-receiver pairs.
